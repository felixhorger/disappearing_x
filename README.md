# Where does the X go?

Count the number of Xs in this image
![Thirteen Xs](there.png)
you should have counted thirteen.
Now, swap the positions of tiles A and B.
You'll get the image below. Count again
![Twelve Xs](disappeared.png)
and you'll find that there are only twelve Xs!
Where did it go?
Try it yourself if you don't believe me, plus, you have the code :)
