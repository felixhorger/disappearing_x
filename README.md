# Where does the X go?

Count the number of Xs in this image
<kbd> ![Thirteen Xs](there.png) </kbd>
you should have counted thirteen.
Now, swap the positions of tiles A and B.
You'll get the image below. Count again
<kbd> ![Twelve Xs](disappeared.png) </kbd>
and you'll find that there are only twelve Xs!
Where did it go?
Try it yourself if you don't believe me, plus, you have the code :)
